--- INSTALL ---
Log in as root and type :
make && make install

--- RUN ---
Load the YAVLD module as root :
modprobe v4l2loopback

now you can feed device created with data and fetch this data by any v4l2 capable program.
try http://code.google.com/p/v4lsink/ as source of video data, it is only tested input program.
v4l1 should also work with little to no additional efforts(effecttv still does not).

works with 2.6.28 kernel only
