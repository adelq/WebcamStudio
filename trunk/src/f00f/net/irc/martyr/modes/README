This directory contains modes.  Unlike commands, errors, and replies,
these modes do NOT contain any information about the mode other than
what it is.  The Mode objects know if the mode takes a parameter, what
character represents the mode, and contain a method to create a new
instance of itself.

You can get and set parameters using the Mode related commands.
