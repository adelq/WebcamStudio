/**
 * Channel is simply a repository for information about a channel.
 * Contains channel name, topic, who created the topic, when the topic
 * was created, who is in the channel, mode, etc.
 *
 * <p>If a user of the framework wishes to use their own Member object
 * (to trap events like setting/removing ops), then subclass
 * Channel and add a method as follows.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public Member makeMember( String member )
 * {
 *     return MyMemberSubClass( member ) );
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Each of the methods in Channel that need to create a Member
 * object (many are just temporary members, for the enhanced 'equals')
 * calls makeMember instead of new Member(...).  That is why this
 * version of addMember is protected, so that a part of the framework
 * won't do something silly like:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *      ...
 *      channel.addMember( new Member( member ) );
 *      ...
 * </pre>
