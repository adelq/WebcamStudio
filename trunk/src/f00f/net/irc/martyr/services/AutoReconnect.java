/**

 * intercepts a QUIT command before the state change that is issued by
 * us (bounced back from the server) then it will not try to
 * reconnect.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that AutoReconnect has no play in nick negotiation, and as
 * such, a failed nick negotiation does not count as a connection
 * retry.</p>
 *
 * <p>Testing note: Does a server send a QUIT before a forceful
 * removal from the network?  Should AutoReconnect not intercept
 * QUITs? Certainly not all servers send QUITs even when you QUIT on
 * your own; this class should be put into a command-out chain as well.</p>
