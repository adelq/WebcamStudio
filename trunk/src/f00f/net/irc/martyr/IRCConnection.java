/**
 * <p><code>IRCConnection</code> is the core class for Martyr.
 * <code>IRCConnection</code> manages the socket, giving commands to the server
 * and passing results to the parse engine.  It manages passing information out
 * to the application via the command listeners and state listeners.
 * <code>IRCConnection</code> has no IRC intelligence of its own, that is left
 * up to the classes on the command and state listener lists.  A number of
 * listeners that do various tasks are provided as part of the framework.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Please read this entirely before using the framework.</b>  Or
 * what the heck, try out the example below and see if it works for ya.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>States and State Listeners</h2>
 * <p><code>IRCConnection</code> is always in one of three states.
 * <code>UNCONNECTED</code>, <code>UNREGISTERED</code> or
 * <code>REGISTERED</code>.  It keeps a list of listeners that
 * would like to know when a state change occurs.  When a state change
 * occurs each listener in the list, in the order they were added, is
 * notified.  If a listener early up on the list causes something to happen
 * that changes the state before your listener gets notified, you will be
 * notified of the state change even though the state has changed.  You
 * will be notified again of the new state.  That is, state change
 * notifications will always be in order, but they may not always reflect
 * the "current" state.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Commands and Command Listeners</h2>
 * <p><code>IRCConnection</code> also keeps a list of listeners for
 * when a command arrives from the server.  When a command arrives, it
 * is first parsed into an object.  That object is then passed around
 * to all the listeners, again, in order.  Commands can be received
 * and the socket closed before the commands are actually send to the
 * listeners, so beware that even though you receive a command, you
 * may not always be guaranteed to have an open socket to send a
 * response back on.  A consumer of the command should never modify
 * the command object.  If you try to send a command to a closed
 * socket, <code>IRCConnection</code> will silently ignore your
 * command.  Commands should always be received in order by all
 * listeners, even if a listener higher up in the list sends a
 * response to the server which elicits a response back from the
 * server before you've been told of the first command.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Connecting and staying connected</h2>
 * <p>The AutoReconnect class can connect you and will try to stay
 * connected.  Using AutoReconnect to connect the
 * first time is recommended, use the <code>go(server,port)</code> method once
 * you are ready to start.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Registration On The Network</h2>
 * <p>The AutoRegister class can register you automatically on the
 * network.  Otherwise, registration is left up to the consumer.
 * Registration should occur any time the state changes to
 * <code>UNREGISTERED</code>.  The consumer will know this because it
 * has registered some class as a state observer.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Auto Response</h2>
 * <p>Some commands, such as Ping require an automatic response.
 * Commands that fall into this category can be handled by the
 * <code>AutoResponder</code> class.  For a list of what commands
 * <code>AutoResponder</code> auto responds to, see the source.</p>
 * 
 * <h2>Joining and Staying Joined</h2>
 * <p>You can use the <code>AutoJoin</code> class to join a channel
 * and stay there.  <code>AutoJoin</code> will try to re-join if
 * kicked or if the connection is lost and the server re-connects.
 * <code>AutoJoin</code> can be used any time a join is desired.  If
 * the server is not connected, it will wait until the server
 * connects.  If the server is connected, it will try to join right
 * away.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Example Usage</h2>
 * <p>You will probably want to at least use the
 * <code>AutoRegister</code> and <code>AutoResponder</code> classes.
 * Example:</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that in the example, the first line is optional.
 * <code>IRCConnection</code> can be called with its default
 * constructor.  See note below about why this is done.
 * <code>IRCConnection</code> will instantiate its own
 * <code>ClientState</code> object if you do not provide one.</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ClientState clientState = new MyAppClientState();
 * IRCConnection connection = new IRCConnection( clientState );
 *
 * // AutoRegister and AutoResponder both add themselves to the
 * // appropriate observerables.  Both will remove themselves with the
 * // disable() method.
 * 
 * AutoRegister autoReg
 *   = new AutoRegister( "repp", "bdamm", "Ben Damm", connection );
 * AutoReconnect autoRecon = new AutoReconnect( connection );
 * AutoResponder autoRes = new AutoResponder( connection );
 *
 * // Very important that the objects above get added before the connect.
 * // If done otherwise, AutoRegister will throw an
 * // IllegalStateException, as AutoRegister can't catch the
 * // state switch to UNREGISTERED from UNCONNECTED.
 *
 * autoRecon.go( server, port );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Client State</h2>
 * <p>The <code>ClientStateMonitor</code> class tells commands to
 * change the client state when they are received.
 * <code>ClientStateMonitor</code> is automatically added to the
 * command queue before any other command, so that you can be
 * guaranteed that the <code>ClientState</code> is updated before any
 * observer sees a command.</p>
 *
 * <p>So, how does an application know when a channel has been joined,
 * a user has joined a channel we are already on, etc?  How does the
 * application get fine-grained access to client state change info?
 * This is a tricky question, and the current solution is to sublcass
 * the <code>clientstate.ClientState</code> and
 * <code>clientstate.Channel</code> classes with your own, overriding
 * the <code>setXxxxXxxx</code> methods.  Each method would call
 * <code>super.setXxxXxxx</code> and then proceed to change the
 * application as required.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Startup</h2>
 * <p>IRCConnection starts in the <code>UNCONNECTED</code> state and
 * makes no attempt to connect until the <code>connect(...)</code>
 * method is called.</p>
 *
 * <p><code>IRCConnection</code> starts a single thread at
 * construction time.  This thread simply waits for events.  An event
 * is a disconnection request or an incoming message.  Events are
 * dealt with by this thread.  If connect is called, a second thread
 * is created to listen for input from the server (InputHandler).
